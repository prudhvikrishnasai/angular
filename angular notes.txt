doubts: *ngIf, *ngFor,
selectedHero?: Hero;
  onSelect(hero: Hero): void {
  this.selectedHero = hero;
  }







notes:
[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.
